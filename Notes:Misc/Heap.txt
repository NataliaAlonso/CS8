Heap

Like a tree, but COMPLETE

In order to move down a level, the entire previous level must be FILLED

Each node is less than its kids, or each node is greater than its kids.

Insert: 
If inserted note is doesn't conform, (is not greater than its parent or vice versa)
1) Can be swapped with root, then move all the other parents down
2) Can be moved up

Re-heapify!

Heap sort

If a heap is implemented as an array, heap can be sorted easily.

For any node in this tree, it is less than its kids.

bitset in C++

bitset<4> mybits; // creats an empty bitset with 4 bits
