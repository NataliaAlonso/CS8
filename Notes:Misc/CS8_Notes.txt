catch(...) is a general catch all

Ternary operator
	x = a > b ? a : b
	"If a>b, then x=a. Else x=b."

FIX ISSUE WITH INSERTION OPERATOR in LinkedList class
Hint for ExtraCredit: Pointers of type void; look at "unions"
a structure for which all fields occupy the same memory location

HINT FOR HOMEWORK 1: With only the node being templated, redo the linked list
HINT FOR HOMEWORK 1: passing type as a parameter C++
Trick that may help: Pointer of type void -> pointer that can point to anything
						CANNOT BE DEFERENCED. Must be static casted. 
						Do with Throw / Catch
						use typeinfo from C std lib
						typeid(x) where x is a data type

Stacks
	First in, last out
	TOS is -1 if empty, index otherwise
	push: input
	pop: output and erase
	empty
	full
	clear
	roll: take the top element and make the bottom element (eg. in HP calculators, rolling is used to store without taking up new memory location)
	resize

STACK
Fix:	Read/write files
		Check error messages

QUEUES
Queue is always fixed length
First-in, first-out
BQ, EQ: Indices for end-of-queue and beginning-of-queue
BQ is where you dequeue
EQ is where you enqueue
Fix:	[] overload

HOMEWORK HINT: 	Create purely virtual access function in linkedList that takes void pointer as parameter
				Force user to write access function which TYPECASTS void pointer

DOUBLY LINKED LIST
Deque: a queue in which you can enqueue or dequeue from either end 
Circular: Ends always point to something

NULL pointers cannot be dereferenced; always must check if pointer exists before trying to deference.
Inorder, go left print then right
Preorder, print, go left, then go right
Post order, go left, then right, then print
