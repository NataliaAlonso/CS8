Reading level:
	The Flesch Formula: Reading Ease and Grade Level
	The Flesch Formula is a more accurate method for measuring the readability of upper elementary texts.
	Select a 100-word sample and count the number of sentences.
	Divide the number of words (100) by the number of sentences and multiply the result by 1.015. Save this result and call it x.
	Count the total number of syllables in the sample, divide by the total number of words (100) and multiply by 84.6 (Or just multiply the number of syllables by 0.846 — the results will be the same). Call this number y.
	Add x to y and subtract the sum from 206.835. The final result is the Reading Ease Score (see table).

	Gunning Fog Index
	The Gunning Fog method is used to determine the readability for upper elementary reading material. Apply the following steps (you may want to use a calculator), and refer to the example for help.
	Select a sample of 100 words and count the number of sentences in the sample.
	Divide the number of sentences into the number of words (100) to find the average sentence length.
	Count the number of “big words” (3 syllables or more) and divide 100 by that number to find the percentage of big words (This is easily done by adding a decimal point two digits before the number).
	Add the average sentence length and percentage of big words together and multiply the sum by 0.4 to find the result.
